# Data: 

The data is a sample extracted from the open TripAdvisor Review dataset from: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jiweil/html/hotel-review.html.

# Business scenario:

The company purchased reviews from Facebook on the company, which are pure texts without giving any numeric ratings on the service product. The company wants you to develop machine learning models and use the models derived from TripAdvisor review data to understand Facebook reviews.

# Project scope:

- Develop a machine learning model to differentiate between good and bad Overall reviews and use it to filter out important keywords necessary for management decision-making.
- Develop a machine learning model to predict whether an author of a review has visited more than 15 cities. This can be used to check the credibility of a review and understand customer preference for effective customer segmentation.

# Project flow:

1. Import and clean the data
2. Filter out relevant data for analysis
3. Build machine learning models
4. Parameters tunning to improve performance
5. Testing and final model selection

# Project contribution to management: 

1. Hotel chain management can utilize these models to identify problematic areas, which can be particular hotels in the chain, the hotel processes or services, and take immediate actions against them.
2. Using the model to extract the perceived strengths and weaknesses of a hotel (chain) to benchmark against its competitors. This can be useful to find unique selling points for increasing competitive advantage.
3. The company can use this model for customer segmentation to improve product and service offerings (Customer segmentation of one principle)
